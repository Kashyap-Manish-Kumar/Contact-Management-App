# 📇 ContactHub – Contact Management System

A full-stack Contact Management application developed as part of the **Mavens SDE Intern Assessment**.

The application allows users to securely manage their contacts through authentication, perform complete CRUD operations, and visualize live COVID-19 statistics using charts and an interactive world map.

## 🌐 Live Demo

🚀 **Application:** https://contact-management-app-nine-drab.vercel.app/

> **Note:** The backend is hosted on Render's free tier. If the API has been inactive for some time, the first request may take **30–60 seconds** while the server wakes up.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to build a modern web application demonstrating authentication, state management, API integration, and responsive UI development.

The application consists of two independent parts:

- **Frontend** – React + TypeScript + Bootstrap
- **Backend** – Express.js + TypeScript + MongoDB Atlas

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs, while COVID-19 statistics are fetched from the public Disease.sh API using React Query.

# 📞 Contact Management

The Contact module is the core functionality of the application. Every authenticated user can create, update, delete, and search their own contacts.

Each contact contains:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone
- Company
- Address
- Status

Redux Toolkit is used for client-side state management, while MongoDB stores the contact information securely.

---

# 📊 Charts Module

The Charts page displays worldwide COVID-19 trends using historical data fetched from the Disease.sh API.

**Why React Query?**

- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Better API state management

**Why Recharts?**

- Responsive charts
- Lightweight
- Easy customization

---

# 🌍 Maps Module

The Maps page displays live COVID-19 statistics for countries around the world using React Leaflet.

Each marker displays:

- Country Name
- Active Cases
- Recovered Cases
- Death Cases

The map data is dynamically fetched from the Disease.sh Countries API.

# 🌐 APIs Used

| API | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `/v3/covid-19/all` | Worldwide Statistics |
| `/v3/covid-19/countries` | Country-wise Statistics |
| `/v3/covid-19/historical/all` | Historical Cases |

# 🚀 Challenges Faced

During development, I worked through several practical challenges:

- Implementing secure JWT authentication.
- Managing application state using Redux Toolkit.
- Integrating React Query with multiple APIs.
- Rendering a large number of map markers efficiently.
- Handling deployment and CORS configuration between frontend and backend.

## 📌 Note

The original assessment recommended **Tailwind CSS** for styling. In this implementation, **Bootstrap 5** was used to build a responsive and consistent user interface while keeping the application architecture and all required functionality aligned with the assignment requirements.
